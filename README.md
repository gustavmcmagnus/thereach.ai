2. [Article on how Google is going through its Kodak moment. If we move to AI powered search, we don't need websites anymore and eventually they will die out. This is a $1.1 trillion disruption.](https://thereach.ai/2024/01/22/the-end-of-the-internet-and-the-last-website-the-1-1-trilion-challenge/)
3. [Prompt engineering was always just a starter. Within the next iterations of AI, natural language will be used a lot more than prompts. Especially with Image AI, we see with Midjourney how they are already dying out.](https://thereach.ai/2024/02/06/prompt-engineering-is-dead/)
